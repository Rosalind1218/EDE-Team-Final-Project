# Rationale and Research Questions
The primary focus is to identify patterns or correlations between weather conditions and changes in air quality metrics, such as AQI (Air Quality Index) and PM2.5 concentrations. The goal of this project is to understand how specific weather variables, such as precipitation and temperature, impact air quality. This research will provide insights into seasonal and weather-related factors contributing to air pollution, offering a some insight for future mitigation strategies, public health advisories, or policy recommendations.

# Dataset Information
We downloaded two datasets, one from EPA Stanislaus_Air_Data to present the air 
quality(include two values we want to examine PM2.5 and AQI values), another is 
weather data from NOAA, we installed "openmeteo” package to process data. Since 
two datasets have different format of dates, we first use mutate function and group
_by month to combine the rows for ensuring the consistency of "yyyy%-mm%" format. 
However, each month has different numbers of observations, we then combine all the 
rows happen in the same month so that we can easier to analyze the data.

>Looking at this graph, it appears that in the last decade, temperatures in Stanislaus County have followed a regular seasonal pattern. It does not show any type of trend year over year. On the other hand, PM2.5 shows a large spike between 2018-2019 and some other smaller spikes which appear to occur at somewhat regular intervals. 

## How do PM2.5 concentrations vary over the course of a year?

>Summary: It looks like from 2013-2023, there is generally an increase in PM2.5 from July onwards, then it dips back down during the winter months. 

>It is possible that there could be a seasonal component to particulate matter. We know that anthropogenic sources of PM 2.5 include combustion from motor vehicles, smelters, power plants, industrial facilities, residential fireplaces/wood stoves, agricultural burning, and forest fires. Thus, it is possible that in California, there could be higher PM 2.5 in the summer, when the risk of forest fires is higher and power plants are burning more fossil fuels to meet peak demand for air conditioning during hot summer months.

>Kendall’s Tau and P-Value
The Kendall's tau coefficient was calculated as -0.0182, which is very close to zero. This means there’s little to no consistent pattern in how the average PM 2.5 changes over time. There is no clear tendency for one to increase or decrease as the other changes.

>The p-value was 0.78741, which is much higher than the typical threshold of 0.05. This means we didn’t find any statistically significant relationship between the avergae PM 2.5 over time To summarize, the analysis shows that the two variables don’t have a strong or consistent relationship in this dataset.

> Results of the Regression Analysis
Performed an analysis to see if there's a relationship between average temperature and average PM2.5 levels in Stanislaus County.

>Relationship Between Temperature and PM2.5:
There is a negative relationship between temperature and PM2.5. This means that as the temperature increases, the PM2.5 levels tend to decrease. However, the effect is small, for each 1°C increase in temperature, PM2.5 drops by about 0.34 µg/m³.

>Model Performance:
The model does a fair job of showing the relationship, but it only explains about 17% of the variation in PM2.5 levels. This means that temperature is just one factor influencing PM2.5, and there are likely other important factors (like wind or pollution sources) that play a bigger role.

>Significance:
The relationship we found between temperature and PM2.5 is statistically significant, meaning it's unlikely to be due to random chance and that temperature does effect on PM2.5. However, temperature only explains a small part of the variation in air quality. Other factors like motor vehicles, smelters, power plants, industrial facilities, residential fireplaces/wood stoves, agricultural burning, and forest fires. 

# Analysis of Variance

## Using a One-Way Anova to test the correlation between temperature and PM2.5.
```{r}
#load package
library(agricolae)

#Get the quantile of the average temperatures 
quantile = summary(combined_air_weather$avg_temperature)
quantile

#Divide temperatures into four categories：very low, low, median, high based on quantile
combined_air_weather_groups = combined_air_weather %>%
  mutate(
    temp_category = cut(
      avg_temperature,
      breaks = c(-2.682, 3.723, 13.727, 22.014, 27.429),
      labels = c("Very Low", "Low", "Medium", "High")
      ))

#Test PM2.5 and Temperature in one-way anova
anova = aov(data = combined_air_weather_groups, avg_PM25 ~ temp_category)
summary(anova)

#Post-hoc test: Tukey HSD
tukey = HSD.test(anova, "temp_category", group = TRUE)
tukey
```

>Summary Based on One-way Anova and Post-hoc Test:
The analysis suggests a significant relationship between temperature categories and PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5 levels are highest in the Very Low Temperature category and decrease as temperatures increase, with the High Temperature category having the lowest PM2.5 levels. This indicates that lower temperatures are associated with higher PM2.5 levels, likely due to reduced atmospheric dispersion and increased emissions from heating sources. However, no significant differences were observed among the Low, Medium, and High temperature categories. Further research is recommended to explore additional factors influencing PM2.5 levels, such as wind speed, humidity, and pollution sources.
