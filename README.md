## Summary
The purpose of this repository is to explore if certain weather variables impact air quality in Stanislaus County, CA. Poor air quality is a significant concern in this region, often exacerbated by local environmental 
conditions and external influences such as wildfires and some industrial emissions. The primary focus is to identify patterns or correlations between weather conditions and changes in air quality metrics, such as AQI 
(Air Quality Index) and PM2.5 concentrations. The goal of this project is to understand how specific weather variables, such as precipitation and temperature, impact air quality. This research will provide insights into 
seasonal and weather-related factors contributing to air pollution, offering a some insight for future mitigation strategies, public health advisories, or policy recommendations.

## Database Information
This repository contains two key datasets:
1. EPA Air Quality Data: Downloaded from the EPAâ€™s outdoor air quality database, this dataset includes daily AQI and PM2.5 readings for Stanislaus County.
2. Weather Data: [Where is this dataset from?] This dataset includes historical daily measurements of weather variables such as precipitation and temperature.
<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>


## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 
Folders included in the repository are "Data" "Raw" "Processed" and "Metadata" The raw data folder includes 10 raw datasets from the EPA air quality website. The processed folder will contain the finalized 
processed air and weather data. The metadata folder will contain the information on both the weather and air quality datasets.
