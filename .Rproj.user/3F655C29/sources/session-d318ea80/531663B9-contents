## Data Wrangling

Uploaded the EPA air quality data for Stanislaus County, California into R,<https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data>. Then combined the 10 csv files into one dataframe. 

```{r cars}
Stanislaus_Air_Files <- list.files(path = "./Data/Raw/Stanislaus_EPAair/",
                                  pattern = "*.csv",
                                  full.names = TRUE)

Stanislaus_Air_Data <- Stanislaus_Air_Files %>% 
  plyr::ldply(read.csv)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
